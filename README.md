example of nonlocal
Why is "hello" printed instead of "Jane"?
x = "Jane" is declared inside myfunc1()

This means x is a local variable inside myfunc1().
myfunc2() is a nested function inside myfunc1()

myfunc2() does not define its own x, but instead it modifies x from myfunc1() using nonlocal.
When myfunc2() is called, x = "hello" modifies the original x in myfunc1()

Since nonlocal x is used, Python does not create a new x inside myfunc2() but instead updates the x from myfunc1().
Finally, myfunc1() returns x, which has been changed to "hello"

So, the output is "hello" instead of "Jane".
